* MOSS 1.0.1 Release Notes
** Bugs Fixed
- Default content-type is not passed into function to handle PUT
  request body
- Requests hang when a node in the Riak cluster is unavailable
- Correct inappropriate use of riak_moss_utils:get_user by
  riak_moss_acl_utils:get_owner_data
* MOSS 1.0.0 Release Notes
** Bugs Fixed
- Fix PUTs for zero-byte files
- Fix fsm initialization race conditions
- Canonicalize the entire path if there is no host header, but there are
  tokens
- Fix process and socket leaks in get fsm
** Other Additions
- Subsystem for calculating user access and storage usage
- Fixed-size connection pool of Riak connections
- Use a single Riak connection per request to avoid deadlock conditions
- Object ACLs
- Management for multiple versions of a file manifest
- Configurable block size and max content length
- Support specifying non-default ACL at bucket creation time
* MOSS 0.1.2 Release Notes
** Bugs Fixed
- Return 403 instead of 503 for invalid anonymous or signed requests.
- Properly clean up processes and connections on object requests.
* MOSS 0.1.1 Release Notes
** Bugs Fixed
- HEAD requests always result in a =403 Forbidden=.
- =s3cmd info= on a bucket object results in an error due to missing
  ACL document.
- Incorrect atom specified in =riak_moss_wm_utils:parse_auth_header=.
- Bad match condition used in =riak_moss_acl:has_permission/2=.

* MOSS 0.1.0 Release Notes
** Bugs Fixed
- =s3cmd info= fails due to missing ='last-modified= key in return document.
- =s3cmd get= of 0 byte file fails.
- Bucket creation fails with status code =415= using the AWS Java SDK.
** Other Additions
- Bucket-level access control lists
- User records have been modified so that an system-wide unique email
  address is required to create a user.
- User creation requests are serialized through =stanchion= to be
  certain the email address is unique.
- Bucket creation and deletion requests are serialized through
  =stanchion= to ensure bucket names are unique in the system.
- The =stanchion= serialization service is now required to be installed
  and running for the system to be fully operational.
- The concept of an administrative user has been added to the system. The credentials of the
  administrative user must be added to the app.config files for =moss= and =stanchion=.
- User credentials are now created using a url-safe base64 encoding module.
** Known Issues
- Object-level access control lists have not yet been implemented.

* MOSS 0.0.3 Release Notes
** Bugs Fixed
- URL decode keys on put so they are represented correctly. This
  eliminates confusion when objects with spaces in their names are
  listed and when attempting to access them.
- Properly handle zero-byte files
- Reap all processes during file puts
** Other Additions
*** Support for the s3cmd subcommands sync, du, and rb
- Return valid size and checksum for each object when listing bucket objects.
- Changes so that a bucket may be deleted if it is empty.

*** Changes so a subdirectory path can be specified when storing or retrieving files.
*** Make buckets private by default
*** Support the prefix query parameter
*** Enhance process dependencies for improved failure handling
** Known Issues
- Buckets are marked as /private/ by default, but globally-unique
    bucket names are not enforced. This means that two users may
    create the same bucket and this could result in unauthorized
    access and unintentional overwriting of files. This will be
    addressed in a future release by ensuring that bucket names are
    unique across the system.
