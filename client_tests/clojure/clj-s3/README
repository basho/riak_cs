# clj-s3


If you don't have a Clojure environment set up, follow these
steps first.

```shell
# this will in Leiningen (often called lein), this Clojure build tool
INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin
curl "https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/1.x/bin/lein" > $INSTALL_DIR/lein
chmod +x $INSTALL_DIR/lein
```

To run the tests, run:

```shell
# if you've never run the tests before,
# you'll need to run this command first
lein deps

# run the tests.
# (midje is a testing
# library for Clojure
#
# Riak CS should be running on http://localhost:8080 (note http
# not https)
#
# # we can add support for configurable host/ports in the future
# as needed
lein midje
```

## About

These tests are written using [Reid's fork](https://github.com/reiddraper/clj-aws-s3)
of [clj-aws-s3](https://github.com/weavejester/clj-aws-s3). The fork adds things
such as proxy configuration, needed to test Riak CS (instead of the real
s3. You can see that, and the other dependencies in `project.clj`. There is
code for creating Riak CS users in `src/java_s3_tests/user_creation.clj`.
New tests cases are added to `test/java_s3_tests/test/client.clj`. The tests
are written using the Clojure testing library [midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje),
[which has great documentation](https://github.com/marick/Midje/wiki).
