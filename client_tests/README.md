# Riak CS Client Library Tests

Within each of the directories at the same level of this README are tests for
language specific S3 client libraries. Executing these tests should typically
be done from the root of the project using `make`.

Example:

```bash
$ make test-boto
```

If you are interested in using the tests to understand how to communicate with
Riak CS, each language sub-directory contains its own `README` with details on
how to get the tests running locally.
