%% @doc Behaviour for Quota / QoS hook point, to save CS systems by
%% limiting loads. The idea of Quota and QoS system is, to limit
%% things by pluggable modules. This is because requirements vastly
%% varies and it is too hard to cover all of them with single
%% implementation.
%%
%% This is experimental feature. These interfaces and behaviour may or
%% may not change until general availability.
%%
%% To use 'inherited' your own module, it should be configured in
%% application environment (set it in advanced.config). The item name
%% is `quota_modules'. Example:
%%
%% {riak_cs, [
%%   {quota_modules, [riak_cs_simple_quota, riak_cs_bwlimiter]},
%%   ...
%% ]},
%%
%% The order of module names is also the order of evaluation. Modules
%% are evaluated every time 1) incoming requests passed every other
%% authentication, authorization works (including ACL, Policy), and 2)
%% all incoming requests successfully finished even if those requests
%% resulted in 50x or whatever.
%%
%% 1) is a callback called `allow/3' and 2) is `update/2` callback.
%% These callbacks are called in each process context, 1) is at
%% mochiweb acceptor and 2) is webmachine log handler. Another
%% callback `start_link/0' is to let supervisor know the quota module
%% needs a state management server or not. These processes can't be
%% added nor removed at runtime, please just control such
%% enabled/disabled status inside plugin modules.
%%
%% Return value of `allow/3' is evaluated at `error_response/3', where
%% client return behaviour can be controlled here, such as http status
%% codes, headers and body.
%%
%% Known limitations:
%% - currently this is only for objects.
%% - separate owner and accessor case: bandwidth and access should be
%%   for accessor, while owner is for usage
%% - no integration tests, please report bugs if you find any!
%% - No cool configuration systems
%% - No cool operation console: use `riak-cs attach' and send msg to processes
%% - Multibag
