0) setup a ~/.riak_test.config file like this:
(Note the extra riak_cs/deps and stanchion/deps)
{rtdev, [
    {rt_deps, ["/Users/dparfitt/test-releases/riak_ee/deps",
	"/Users/dparfitt/test-releases/riak_cs/deps",
	"/Users/dparfitt/test-releases/stanchion/deps"]},
    {rt_max_wait_time, 180000},
    {rt_retry_delay, 500},
    {rt_harness, rtdev},
	  
    {rtdev_path, [{root, "/tmp/rt"},
                  {current, "/tmp/rt/current"},
                  {"1.2.0", "/tmp/rt/riak-1.2.0"},
                  {"1.1.4", "/tmp/rt/riak-1.1.4"},
                  {"1.0.3", "/tmp/rt/riak-1.0.3"}]}
]}.

1) export RT_TARGET_CURRENT=/tmp/rt/current
2) read through setup.sh to see what it's doing
3) add the following to /etc/hosts:
127.0.0.1 riak_test_bucket.localhost
4) run setup.sh
