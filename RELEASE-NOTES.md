## Notes on Upgrading

### Unaborted or incomplete multipart uploads

[riak_cs/#475](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/475) was a
security issue where a newly created bucket may include unaborted or
incomplete multipart uploads which was created in previous epoch of
the bucket with same name. This was fixed by:

- on creating buckets; checking if live multipart exists and if
  exists, return 500 failure to client.

- on deleting buckets; trying to clean up all live multipart remains,
  and checking if live multipart remains (in stanchion). if exists,
  return 409 failure to client.

Note that a few operations are needed after upgrading from 1.4.x (or
former) to 1.5.0.

- run `riak_cs_console:cleanup_orphan_multipart/0` or
  `riak_cs_console:cleanup_orphan_multipart/1` in an attached console
  to cleanup all buckets
- there might be a time period until above cleanup finished, where no
  client can create bucket if unfinished multipart upload remains
  under deleted bucket. You can find [critical] log if such bucket
  creation is attempted.

### Leeway seconds and disk space

[riak_cs/#470](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/470) changed the
behaviour of object deletion and garbage collection. The timestamps in
garbage collection bucket were changed from the current time when the
object is deleted, to the future time when the object is to be
deleted. Garbage collector was also changed to collect objects until
'now - leeway seconds', from collecting objects until 'now'.

Before:

```
           t1                         t2
-----------+--------------------------+------------------->
           DELETE object:             GC triggered:
           marked as                  collects objects
           "t1+leeway"                marked as "t2"
```

After:

```
           t1                         t2
-----------+--------------------------+------------------->
           DELETE object:             GC triggered:
           marked as "t1"             collects objects
           in GC bucket               marked as "t2 - leeway"
```

This leads that there exists a period where no objects are collected
right after upgrade to 1.5.0, say, `t0`, until `t0 + leeway` . And
objects deleted just before `t0` won't be collected until `t0 +
2*leeway` .

Also, all CS nodes which run GC should be upgraded *first.* CS nodes
which do not run GC should be upgraded later, to let leeway second
system work properly. Or stop GC while upgrading whole cluster, by
running `riak-cs-gc interval infinity` .

Multi-datacenter cluster should be upgraded more carefully, as to
make sure GC is not running while upgrading.


# Riak CS 1.4.5 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

* Fix several 'data hiding' bugs with the v2 list objects FSM [riak_cs/788](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/788)
* Don't treat HEAD requests toward BytesOut in access statistics [riak_cs/791](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/791)
* Handle whitespace in POST/PUT XML documents [riak_cs/795](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/795)
* Fix bad bucketname in storage usage [riak_cs/800](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/800)
  Riak CS 1.4.4 introduced a bug where storage calculations made while running
  that version would have the bucket-name replaced by the string "struct". This
  version fixes the bug, but can't go back and retroactively fix the old
  storage calculations. Aggregations on an entire user-account should still
  be accurate, but you won't be able to break-down storage by bucket, as they
  will all share the name "struct".
* Handle unicode user-names and XML [riak_cs/807](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/807)
* Fix missing XML fields on storage usage [riak_cs/808](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/808)
* Adjust fold-objects timeout [riak_cs/811](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/811)
* Prune deleted buckets from user record [riak_cs/812](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/812)

## Additions

* Optimize the list objects v2 FSM for prefix requests [riak_cs/804](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/804)

# Riak CS 1.4.4 Release Notes

This is a bugfix release. The major fixes are to the storage calculation.

## Bugs Fixed

* Create basho-patches directory [riak_cs/775](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/775) .

* `sum_bucket` timeout crashes all storage calculation is fixed by [riak_cs/759](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/759) .

* Failure to throttle access archiver is fixed by [riak_cs/758](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/758) .

* Access archiver crash is fixed by [riak_cs/747](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/747) .

  objects written with a version of Riak CS older than 1.3.0.

## Additions

- Add option to delay initial GC sweep on a node using the
  initial_gc_delay configuration option.
- Append random suffix to GC bucket keys to avoid hot keys and improve
  performance during periods of frequent deletion.
- Add default_proxy_cluster_id option to provide a way to specify a
  default cluster id to be used when the cluster id is undefined. This is
  to facilitate migration from the OSS version to the
  Enterprise version.

  overwrite or delete that could lead to old object versions being
  resurrected.
- Fix improper capitalization of user metadata header names.
- Fix issue where the S3 rewrite module omits any query parameters
  that are not S3 subresources. Also correct handling of query
  parameters so that parameter values are not URL decoded twice. This
  primarily affects pre-signed URLs because the access key and request
  signature are included as query parameters.
- Fix for issue with init script stop.

# Riak CS 1.3.0 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- Fix handling of cases where buckets have siblings. Previously this
  resulted in 500 errors returned to the client.
- Reduce likelihood of sibling creation when creating a bucket.
- Return a 404 instead of a 403 when accessing a deleted object.
- Unquote URLs to accommodate clients that URL encode `/` characters
  in URLs.

  5MB-5GB.
- Support for bucket policies using a restricted set of principals and
  conditions.
- Support for returning bytes ranges of a file using the Range header.
- Administrative commands may be segrated onto a separate interface.
- Authentication for administrative commands may be disabled.
- Performance and stability improvements for listing the contents of
  buckets.
- Support for the prefix, delimiter, and marker options when listing
  the contents of a bucket.

# Riak CS 1.2.2 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- Fix problem where objects with utf-8 unicode key cannot be listed
  nor fetched.
- Speed up bucket_empty check and fix process leak. This bug was
  originally found when a user was having trouble with `s3cmd
  rb s3://foo --recursive`. The operation first tries to delete the
  (potentially large) bucket, which triggers our bucket empty
  check. If the bucket has more than 32k items, we run out of
  processes unless +P is set higher (because of the leak).

## Additions

- Full support for MDC replication

# Riak CS 1.2.1 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- Return 403 instead of 404 when a user attempts to list contents of
  nonexistent bucket.

  the default mode, only the administrator is allowed to create
  accounts.
- Ping resource for health checks.
- Support for user-specified metadata headers.
- User accounts may be disabled by the administrator.

- Object ACLs
- Management for multiple versions of a file manifest
- Configurable block size and max content length
- Support specifying non-default ACL at bucket creation time

# Riak CS 0.1.2 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- Return 403 instead of 503 for invalid anonymous or signed requests.
- Properly clean up processes and connections on object requests.

# Riak CS 0.1.1 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- HEAD requests always result in a `403 Forbidden`.
- `s3cmd info` on a bucket object results in an error due to missing
  ACL document.
- Incorrect atom specified in `riak_moss_wm_utils:parse_auth_header`.
- Bad match condition used in `riak_moss_acl:has_permission/2`.

# Riak CS 0.1.0 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- `s3cmd info` fails due to missing `'last-modified` key in return document.
- `s3cmd get` of 0 byte file fails.
- Bucket creation fails with status code `415` using the AWS Java SDK.

## Other Additions

- Bucket-level access control lists
- User records have been modified so that an system-wide unique email
  address is required to create a user.
- User creation requests are serialized through `stanchion` to be
  certain the email address is unique.
- Bucket creation and deletion requests are serialized through
  `stanchion` to ensure bucket names are unique in the system.
- The `stanchion` serialization service is now required to be installed
  and running for the system to be fully operational.
- The concept of an administrative user has been added to the system. The credentials of the
  administrative user must be added to the app.config files for `moss` and `stanchion`.
- User credentials are now created using a url-safe base64 encoding module.

## Known Issues

- Object-level access control lists have not yet been implemented.

# Riak CS 0.0.3 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- URL decode keys on put so they are represented correctly. This
  eliminates confusion when objects with spaces in their names are
  listed and when attempting to access them.
- Properly handle zero-byte files
- Reap all processes during file puts

## Other Additions

- Support for the s3cmd subcommands sync, du, and rb

 - Return valid size and checksum for each object when listing bucket objects.
 - Changes so that a bucket may be deleted if it is empty.

- Changes so a subdirectory path can be specified when storing or retrieving files.
- Make buckets private by default
- Support the prefix query parameter

- Enhance process dependencies for improved failure handling

## Known Issues

- Buckets are marked as /private/ by default, but globally-unique
  bucket names are not enforced. This means that two users may
  create the same bucket and this could result in unauthorized
  access and unintentional overwriting of files. This will be
  addressed in a future release by ensuring that bucket names are
  unique across the system.
