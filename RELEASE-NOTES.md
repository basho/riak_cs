# Riak CS 3.2.3 Release Notes

Released December 24, 2023.

## General

Incremental release, with features complementary to the more
substantial release of Riak CS Control 3.2.3.

## New features

* New IAM call `ListAttachedRolePolicies`.
* New admin API endpoint /riak-cs/temp-sessions, listing the currently
  active assumed roles.

## Bug fixes

* `GetSAMLProvider` now includes `SAMLMetadataDocument` field as it
  should have.
* `CreateSAMLProvider` fixed for the case when request is made without
  tags.
* `CreateBucket` by federated users now properly returns 400 (and
  not 500).
* Fix `ListBucket` for federated users with appropriate policy
* Federated users' policies are now correctly evaluated in operations
  on objects.
* Operations involving role update do not double-base64 encode its
  `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` anymore.
* Improved locking when updating users and roles in `AttachUserPolicy`
  and `DetachuserPolicy` (same for roles).



# Riak CS 3.2.2 Release Notes

Released November 4, 2023.

## General

This is mostly a bug-fix release, with a smattering of small
improvements enabling it to operate with the new Riak CS Control
(version 3.2.2, rewritten in Elm).

## New features

* New admin API endpoint, /riak-cs/info, currently reporting Riak CS version
  and uptime.
* New riak-cs admin command, `create-admin-user`, intended to help
  create an admin user on a fresh install of Riak CS.
* New helper script, `prepare-riak-for-cs`, which prepares riak
  configuration files in /etc/riak to work with locally co-installed
  Riak CS. This script is installed in /usr/lib/riak-cs/bin (or
  /usr/lib64/... on other distros).

## Bug fixes

### Critical bugs

* In 3.2.x, admin user signature was not verified in IAM calls.

### Less critical bugs

* Fix DeleteUserPolicy when called on a policy with a non-zero
  attachment count.
* GetUser now includes PermissionsBoundary in its XML response.
* Fix parsing of IsAttachable parameter in *Policy calls.
* Fix updating user email via PUT to /riak-cs/user.


# Riak CS 3.2.1 Release Notes

Released September 3, 2023.

## Bug fixes

This is a bugfix release addressing the issue of temporary sessions
created for federated users as a direct result of AssumeRoleWithSAML,
not expiring after DurationSeconds if the Riak CS node which received
this request is restarted.


# Riak CS 3.2.0 Release Notes

Released August 25, 2023.

## New Features

This release includes basic support for IAM entities such as roles and
standalone policies, and federated users. The following new API calls are implemented:

* IAM:
  * CreateRole, GetRole, DeleteRole, ListRoles;
  * CreatePolicy, GetPolicy, DeletePolicy, ListPolicies;
  * AttachRolePolicy, AttachUserPolicy, DetachRolePolicy,
    DetachUserPolicy, ListAttachedUserPolicies;
  * CreateSAMLProvider, GetSAMLProvider, DeleteSAMLProvider,
    ListSAMLProviders.
* STS:
  * AssumeRoleWithSAML (with [this specific use case](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_saml.html#CreatingSAML-configuring)
in mind).

Note that as a Service Provider, Riak CS does not currently accept
encrypted SAML assertions.

## Changes

### User-visible changes

* A script, tools/create-admin, is provided to facilitate the creation
  of admin user. This script will also create a policy permitting
  all S3, IAM and STS calls and attach it to the admin user. The
  script requires python3 with httplib2 and boto3.

* Changed configuration items:
  * `fold_objects_for_list_keys` was removed, along with legacy
    riak\_cs\_list\_objects\_fsm.erl, long slated for removal in favor of riak\_cs\_list\_objects\_fsm_v2.erl.
  * New key, `iam_create_user_default_email_host`, that defines the domain
    used to construct (artificial) email from the UserName parameter
    to the iam:CreateUser call.
  * `cs_root_host` renamed to `s3_root_host`.
  * Default values for keys `rewrite_module`, `auth_module` have
    changed to "riak\_cs\_aws\_rewrite" and "riak\_cs\_aws\_auth".
  * `dtrace` key was removed, along with code supporting it.

* `riak-cs stop` now prints "ok" on success, as in good old Basho times.

### Other changes

* Rebar was upgraded to version 3.22.
* riak\_cs\_multibag, a companion application previously existing in
  its own repo, has been incorporated into Riak CS.
* Users are now stored by their arns as keys, as do all IAM entities.
* Many files and structures have been renamed to reflect the fact that
  now Riak CS provides IAM and STS services, in addition to S3 around
  which it was originally designed.
* Throughout the entire code base, calls to mochijson2 facilities were
  replaced with corresponding jsx and jason functions.
* In many internal structures, strings were replaced with binaries,
  and timestamps previously stored as `calendar:datetime()`, have been
  converted to plain unixtime, in milliseconds.

## Compatibility

This release is forward-compatible with 3.1.0. Users and data written
by 3.1.0 can be read in 3.2.0. User records updated or created in 3.1
will have a new layout (rcs\_user\_v3), and *will not* be accessible
from older versions of Riak CS.


# Riak CS 3.1.0 Release Notes

Released March 15, 2023.

## General

This release is centred around a single architectural change:
the merge of Stanchion into Riak CS. There are no substantial additions
in the scope of supported S3 methods, and no changes to the behaviour
or feature set otherwise.

## New features

* Stanchion, which was a separate Erlang application serving the
  purpose of serializing CRUD operations on users and buckets, and
  therefore had to be deployed and run alongside Riak CS nodes on a
  dedicated node, is now colocated on one of the Riak CS nodes.

  In `auto` mode, it is dynamically created at the Riak CS node
  receiving the first request that needs to be serialized. This node
  will then store Stanchion details (ip:port) in a special service
  bucket on a configured Riak KV node. Riak CS nodes will read that
  ip:port and send subsequent Stanchion requests to that endpoint. If
  a Riak CS node finds that Stanchion is unreachable, it will spawn a
  new instance on its premises and update the details in Riak KV. When
  a node that previously hosted Stanchion, after being temporarily
  unavailable, sees the Stanchion ip:port has changed, it will stop
  its Stanchion instance.

* Riak CS now can be built on OTP-22 through 25.

* A new subcommand, `supps` has been added to `riak-cs admin`, which
  will produce a ps-like output for the processes in the riak_cs main
  supervisor tree with some stats.

## Changes

### User-visible changes

* New configuration parameters:

  - `stanchion_hosting_mode`, with acceptable values: `auto`,
    `riak_cs_with_stanchion`, `riak_cs_only`, `stanchion_only`
    (default is `auto`).

  - `tussle_voss_riak_host` ("voss" stands for "VOlatile, Storage,
    Serialized"), which can be set to `auto` or a fqdn:port at which
    riak_cs will store Stanchion details. A value of `auto` is
    equivalent to setting it to `riak_host`. The purpose of this
    parameter is to enable users operating in suboptimal networking
    conditions to set it to a dedicated, single-node riak cluster on
    a separate network, which can be made more reliable than the one
    carrying S3 traffic.

  - `stanchion_port`, port at which Stanchion instance will
    listen (if/when this node gets to start it).

  - `stanchion_subnet` and `stanchion_netmask` (with default values of
    "127.0.0.1" and "255.255.255.255" respectively), to use when selecting which
    network to place Stanchion on.

* `riak-cs admin stanchion switch` command has been removed. The
  purpose of this command was to enable operators to change the
  ip:port of Stanchion endpoint without restarting the node. With
  Stanchion location now being set dynamically and discovered
  automatically, there is no need to expose an option for operators to
  intervene in this process.

### Other changes

* A fair bit of work has gone to uplift riak\_cs\_test, hopefully
  making life easier for the next decade. Specifically:

  - we switched erlcloud from an ancient, Basho-patched fork to
    upstream (tag 3.6.7), incidentally triggereing (and fixing) a bug
    with /stats endpoint, which previously only accepted v2
    signatures.

  - riak\_cs\_test can be built with OTP-24, and has lager replaced
    by the standard kernel logger facility.

  - php and ruby tests have been updated and re-included in external
    client tests.

* [Riak CS Service
  Bundle](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/riak_cs_service_bundle) has been
  updated to accommodate stanchion-less version of Riak CS.


# Riak CS 3.0.1 Release Notes

Released June 10, 2022.

## General

This is a correction release that includes one feature that slipped
from 3.0.0.

## New features

* Support for fqdn data type for `riak_host` and `stanchion_host`
  configuration items in riak-cs.conf.

## Changes

### User-visible changes

* S3 request signature v4 is now the default. The old (v2) signatures
  continue to be supported.
* A change of internal structures needed to support object versions,
  meaning downgrade to 2.x is no longer possible (even if the objects
  created with 3.0 have no versions). Upgrade from 2.x is possible.
* The rpm and deb packages now rely on systemd (old-style SysV init
  scripts are no longer included).

### Other changes

* Riak CS and Stanchion now require OTP-22 and rebar3.
* Riak CS Test framework:
  - The framework, along with a suite of tests (also the [multibag
    additions](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/riak_cs_multibag)), has been
    upgraded to OTP-22/rebar3 and moved into a separate project,
    [riak_cs_test](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/riak_cs_test).
  - A new battery of tests is written for `s3cmd` as a client.
  - The Python client tests have been upgraded to boto3 and python-3.9.
* A refactoring of code shared between Riak CS and stanchion resulted
  in that code being collected into a separate dependency,
  [rcs_common](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/rcs_common).
* [Riak CS Control](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/riak_cs_control)
  application has been upgraded to OTP-22/rebar3, too, however without
  any new features.
* All EQC tests have been converted to use PropEr (no shortcuts taken,
  all coverage is preserved).

## Upgrading

Existing data in the riak cluster underlying a 2.x instance of Riak CS
can be used with Riak CS 3.0 without any modification.

*Note:* Once a new object is written into a database by Riak CS 3.0,
that database cannot be used again with 2.x.

## Compatibility


# Riak CS 3.0.0 Release Notes

Released May 30, 2022.

## General

This release was originally envisaged as an uplift of 2.1.2 to OTP-22
and rebar3. There were no known critical bugs that needed fixing. We did,
however, identifiy and implement a new S3 API call
(`ListObjectVersions` and related), to give more substance to the
major version bump.

We also provide Dockerfiles, and a [Riak CS Docker Service
Bundle](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/riak_cs_service_bundle), as a
convenient way to set up the full Riak CS suite locally.

All principal repositories are in [TI Tokyo
org](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo) on Github.

This release was [presented](https://youtu.be/CmmeYza5HPg) at Code
BEAM America 2021.

## New features

* Support for **[object
 versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html)**,
 including new S3 API calls:
  - [`GetBucketVersioning`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketVersioning.html),
    [`PutBucketVersioning`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutBucketVersioning.html) and
    [`ListObjectVersions`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectVersions.html).
    - For buckets with versioning enabled, `GetObject` will return the
      specific version if it is given in the request, or the `null`
      version if it is not.
    - As a Riak CS extension, rather than generating a random id for the
      new version, `PutObject` will read a `versionId` from header
      `x-rcs-versionid`, and use that instead.
* Riak CS Suite as a [Docker
  service](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/riak_cs_service_bundle),
  allowing the (prospective) users quickly to bring up a fully functional Riak
  CS cluster running locally, complete with Riak CS Control, and
  - properly configured and set up with a new user, whose credentials
    will be shown;
  - with riak data persisted;
  - ready for a [load-test](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/s3-benchmark).
* Packaging:
  - **New packages** are provided for FreeBSD 13 and OSX 14 (in the latter
    case, the package is the result of `make rel` tarred; no special
    user is created).
  - Packages have been verified for:
    * RPM-based: Centos 7 and 8, Amazon Linux 2, SLES 15, Oracle
      Linux 8;
    * DEB-based: Debian 8 and 11, Ubuntu Bionic and Xenial;
    * Other: FreeBSD 13, OSX 14; Alpine Linux 3.15.
* A **Dockerfile**, bypassing cuttlefish mechanism to enable run-time
  configuration via environment variables.
* `riak-cs-admin` now has a new option, **`test`**, which creates a bucket
  and performs a basic write-read-delete cycle in it (useful to test
  that the riak cluster is configured properly for use with Riak CS).

## Changes

### User-visible changes

* S3 request signature v4 is now the default. The old (v2) signatures
  continue to be supported.
* A change of internal structures needed to support object versions,
  meaning downgrade to 2.x is no longer possible (even if the objects
  created with 3.0 have no versions). Upgrade from 2.x is possible.

  [rcs_common](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/rcs_common).
* [Riak CS Control](https://github.com/TI-Tokyo/riak_cs_control)
  application has been upgraded to OTP-22/rebar3, too, however without
  any new features.
* All EQC tests have been converted to use PropEr (no shortcuts taken,
  all coverage is preserved).

## Upgrading

Existing data in the riak cluster underlying a 2.x instance of Riak CS
can be used with Riak CS 3.0 without any modification.

*Note:* Once a new object is written into a database by Riak CS 3.0,
that database cannot be used again with 2.x.

## Compatibility

Riak CS 3.0 has been tested with Riak versions 2.2.6, 2.9.8 through
.10, and 3.0.7 and .9. It requires Stanchion 3.0.0 (2.x versions not
supported due to changes in the manifest record).


# Riak CS 2.1.2 Release Notes

Released April 7, 2019.

This is a backwards-compatible* release that updates node_package to address a recent [Product Advisory](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/community/product-advisories/codeinjectioninitfiles/), as well as fixes several bugs.

Riak CS 2.1 is designed to work with Riak KV 2.1.1+.

>*This release is backwards compatible only with the Riak CS 2.x series.

### Upgrading

**For anyone updating to 2.1.2 from 2.1.1 and older versions.**

During the update to 2.1.2, a '==' omitted upload ID might be passed to a Riak CS node running an older version of CS. This may lead to process-crash by failing on decoding upload ID.

## Changes
* For s3cmd users, experimental signature_v4 support has been made available through a simple on/off toggle in riak-cs.conf. With a default setting of "off", it allows in-situ upgrades without the need to change s3cfg files until after all nodes have been upgraded. Note: this function is currently unfinished and suffers from compatibility issues with some clients ([#1058](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1058) / [#1060](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1060)) and one potential security issue ([#1059](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1059)
* Experimental support for Leveled (the alternative to LevelDB to be released with Riak KV 2.9) has been successfully tested with the Riak KV 2.9.0 Release Candidates.
* Due to a recent [Product Advisory](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/community/product-advisories/codeinjectioninitfiles/), node_package was bumped to version 3.0.0 to prevent a potential code injection on the riak init file. [[Issue 1297](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1297), [PR 1306](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1306), & [PR 109](https://github.com/basho/stanchion/pull/109)]
* Multipart upload IDs no longer contain trailing '=' characters, which caused trouble for some clients. This change also makes upload IDs URL-safe. [[PR 1316](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1316)]
* When Riak is unavailable due to network partition or node being offline, a 500 error is returned. [[PR 1298](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1298)]
* Switched from `make` to `${MAKE}` to facilitate easier building on FreeBSD and related platforms

## Bugs Fixed

* [[Issue 1100](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1100)/[PR 1304](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1304)] When a multipart completion request was empty, Riak CS would return a "Completed" message. Now, during a multipart upload, the "complete" message contains a list of part IDs and MD5 hashes. If it is empty, it returns a "400 Bad Request, Malformed" XML message like S3.
* [[Issue 1288](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1288)/[PR 1302](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1302)] The `root_host` configuration parameter is now used to populate the `Location` response element.
* [[Issue 972](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/972)/[PR 1296](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1296)] 'adderss' now reads 'address' in Stanchion console output.
* [[Issue 1025](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1025)/[PR 1300](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1300)] Copying an object used to fail when connecting via HTTPS.


# Riak S2 (Riak CS) 2.1.1 Release Notes

## General Information
This is a bugfix release.

## Bug Fixes

* Remove blocks and manifest in cases of client-side failure, eg:
  incomplete upload, network issues, or other unexpected transfer failures.
  If the manifest was writing and no overwrite happened after upload canceled,
  then the partially uploaded blocks and manifest are left as is, occupying
  disk space. This is fixed by adding an error handling routine to move the
  manifest to the garbage collection bucket by catching the socket error.
  Partially uploaded blocks and manifests will eventually be deleted by
  garbage collection. ([#770](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/770) /
  [PR#1280](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1280))
* Remove `admin.secret` from riak-cs.conf and stanchion.conf. Both
  Riak CS and Stanchion searched riak-cs.conf and stanchion.conf to
  find who was the administrator using `admin.key` and `admin.secret`.
  Writing down `admin.secret` in non-encrypted form compromises the
  security of the system. The administrator is able to (1) list all
  users, (2) disable/enable other users, (3) changing user accounts,
  and (4) read access and storage statistics of all users. A workaround
  for this is encrypting the partition that includes the /etc/riak-cs
  directory. ([#1274](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1274) /
  [PR#1279](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1279) /
  [PR#108](https://github.com/basho/stanchion/pull/108))
* Use /etc/riak-cs/app.config when no generated config file is found.
  This prevents an error when using app.config/vm.args instead of
  riak.conf, such as when upgrading from 1.5.x.
  ([#1261](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1261)/
  [PR#1263](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1263)
  as [PR#1266](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1266))
* Allow any bytes (including non-UTF8 ones) in List Objects response
  XML. List Objects API had been failing in cases where an object with
  non-UTF8 characters in its name was included in the result. With this
  change, such keys are represented in the result of List Objects as
  raw binaries, although it may not be proper XML 1.0.
  ([#974](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/974) /
  [PR#1255](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1255) /
  [PR#1275](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1275))

## Notes on Upgrade

* We strongly recommend removing `admin.secret` from
  riak-cs.conf and stanchion.conf, and `admin_secret` from the
  `advanced.config` files of Riak CS and Stanchion.
* On startup, Riak CS now verifies that the value of `admin.key`
  is either a valid Riak CS user key or the placeholder value
  `admin-key`. For an user with a non-existent or invlaid user
  key, Riak CS process won't start. Also, any `admin.secret` will
  be ignored. The initial procedure to create the very first
  account, starting `anonymous_user_creation = true`, does not change.

#Riak S2 (Riak CS) 2.1.0 Release Notes

Released October 13, 2015.

This is a backwards-compatible* release that introduces a new metrics system, garbage collection refinements, and several other new features. Riak S2 2.1 is designed to work with both Riak KV 2.0.5+ and 2.1.1+.

**Note:** This release is backwards compatible only with the Riak S2 2.x series.

###Riak KV 2.1.1 Usage Note
Riak KV 2.1.1 includes a copy of `riak_cs_kv_multi_backend`, therefore there is no need to add lines specifying special `multi_backend` and `add_paths` configurations in advanced.config.

Instead, you can set the following in riak.conf:

```
storage_backend = prefix_multi
cs_version = 20100
```

If you need storage calculation, you will still require the `add_paths` config to load MapReduce codes into Riak KV.


## New Features
### Metrics
New metrics have been added that enable you to determine the health of your Riak S2 system, as well as get reports on your storage utilization per bucket or user. The following stats items are available:
  * All calls, latencies, and counters in the S3 API
  * All calls, latencies, and counters in Stanchion
  * All Riak Erlang client operations, latencies, and counters
  * Information about the counts (active, idle, and overflow) for the process pool and connection pool
  * System information, versions, port count, and process count
  * Memory information about the riak-cs virtual machine
  * HTTP listener information: active sockets and waiting acceptors

**Note:** stats item names from prior to 2.0.x are not preserved; they have been renamed or removed. No backward consistency is maintained. Please see [the documentation](docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/Monitoring-and-Metrics/) for more information.

* [[PR 1189](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1189)]
* [[PR 1180](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1180)]
* [[PR 1214](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1214)]
* [[PR 1194](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1194)]
* [[PR 99](https://github.com/basho/stanchion/pull/99)]

Additional storage usage metrics are also available. . These metrics are gathered during storage calculation. Gathering these metrics is off by default, but you can turn it on by setting `detailed_storage_calc` to `true` in advanced.config. When you enable this option, you have access to information about how many manifests are `writing`, `pending_delete`, `scheduled_delete` and `active` which is not visible via the API.

**Note:** Metrics do not always correctly reflect actual disk usage. For instance, `writing` may indicate more space than is actually used. Or, for example, if an upload was cancelled in the middle, the calculation does not know how much actual storage space is consumed. In the same way, `scheduled_delete` also may not reflect the exact amount of disk usage because blocks might already be partially deleted by garbage collection.

* [[PR 1120](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1120)]

###`riak-cs-admin`
The following administration CLIs have been replaced by the [`riak-cs-admin` command](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/command-line-tools/):

* `riak-cs-storage`
* `riak-cs-gc`
* `riak-cs-access`
* `riak-cs-stanchion`

The commands listed above are deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

* [[PR 1175](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1175)]

###Garbage Collection Refinements
Several new options have been added to the `riak-cs-admin gc` command:

* `active_delete_threshold` is an option to avoid delegating manifests and block deletion to garbage collector. This option relieves garbage collector from having to delete small objects. This can optimise performance in cases where both garbage collector does not catch up with DELETE Object API calls and garbage collector's elapsed time is dominated by small objects.[[PR 1174](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1174)]
* `--start` and `--end` options have been added to the `riak-cs-admin gc batch` command to specify start and end in manual batch execution. Note that the `--start` flag on the command line will overwrite the `epoch_start` option in advanced.config. [[PR 1147 ](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1147)]
* `--leeway` has been added to create a temporary leeway period whose values are used only once and not repeated at the next run, and `--max-workers` has been added to allow you to override the concurrency value temporarily for a single run of garbage collector. [[PR 1147 ](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1147)]
* Riak S2 2.0 (and older) has a race condition where fullsync replication and garbage collection may resurrect deleted blocks without any way to delete them again. When real-time replication and replication of a garbage collection bucket entry object being dropped from the real-time queue are combined, blocks may remain on the sink side without being collected. Riak S2 2.1 introduces deterministic garbage collection to avoid fullsync replication. Additionally, garbage collection and fullsync replication run concurrently, and work on the same blocks and manifests. You can now specify the range of time using the `--start` and `--end` flags with `riak-cs-admin gc batch` for garbage collector in order to collect deleted objects synchronously on both sink and source sides. [[PR 1147 ](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1147)]
* `riak-cs-admin gc earliest-keys` is available so you can find the oldest entry after `epoch_start` in garbage collection. With this option, you can stay informed of garbage collection progress. [[PR 1160](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1160)]

More information on garbage collection can be found in the [documentation](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/garbage-collection/).


##Additions
###Open Source
* A MapReduce optimisation in fetching Riak objects was introduced in Riak 2.1. Now, Riak CS 2.1 introduces an option to use that optimisation in storage calculation. It is off by default, but it can be used by setting `use_2i_for_storage_calc` as `true` in advanced.config. This reduced 50% of I/O in LevelDB. [[PR 1089](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1089)]
* Erlang/OTP 17 support is now included. [[PR 1245](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1245) and [PR 1040](https://github.com/basho/stanchion/pull/1040)]
* A module-level hook point for limiting user access and quota usage is now available with very preliminary, simple, node-wide limiting example modules. Operators can make, plug in, or combine different modules as quota-limiting, rate-limiting or bandwidth-limiting depending on their unique requirements. [[PR 1118](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1118)]
*  An orphaned block scanner is now available. [[PR 1133](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1133)]
* `riak-cs-admin audit-bucket-ownership` is a new tool to check integrity between users and buckets added. For example, it can be used in cases where a bucket is visible when listing buckets but not accessible, or a bucket is visible and exists but could not be deleted. [[PR 1202](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1202)]
* The following log rotation items have been added to cuttlefish:
    * log.console.size
    * log.console.rotation
    * log.console.rotation.keep
    * log.error.rotation
    * log.error.rotation.keep
    * log.error.size

[[PR 1164](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1164) and [PR 97](https://github.com/basho/stanchion/pull/97)]

* `riak_cs_wm_common` now has a default callback of `multiple_choices`, which prevents `code_server` from becoming a bottleneck. [[PR 1181](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1181)]
* An option has been added to replace the `PR=all user GET` option with `PR=one` just before authentication. This option improves latency, especially in the presence of slow (or actually-failing) nodes blocking the whole request flow because of PR=all. When enabled, a user's owned-bucket list is never pruned after a bucket is deleted, instead it is just marked as deleted. [[PR 1191](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1191)]
* An info log has been added when starting a storage calculation batch. [[PR 1238](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1238)]
* `GET Bucket` requests now have clearer responses. A 501 stub for Bucket lifecycle and a  simple stub for Bucket requestPayment have been added. [[PR 1223](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1223)]
* Several user-friendly features have been added to [`riak-cs-debug`](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/command-line-tools/): fine-grained information gathering options, user-defined filtering for configuration files, and verbose output for failed commands. [[PR 1236](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1236)]

###Enterprise
* MDC has `proxy_get`, which make block objects propagate to site clusters when they are requested. Now, multibag configuration with MDC supports `proxy_get`. [[PR 1171](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1171) and [PR 25](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs_multibag/pull/25)]
* Multibag is now renamed to "Supercluster". A bag has been a set of replicated underlying Riak clusters, which is now **a member of a supercluster**. `riak-cs-multibag` command has been renamed as `riak-cs-supercluster` as well. [[PR 1257](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1257)], [[PR 1260](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1260)], [[PR 106](https://github.com/basho/stanchion/pull/106)], [[PR 107](https://github.com/basho/stanchion/pull/107)] and [[PR 31](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs_multibag/pull/31)].
* Several internal operation tools have been added to help diagnose or address
  issues. [[PR 1145](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1145),
  [PR 1134](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1134), and
  [PR 1133](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1133)]
* Added a generic function for manual operations to resolve siblings of manifests and blocks, which will assist Basho Client Service Engineers with troubleshooting and solving issues. [[PR 1188](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1188)]


##Changes
* Dependency versions have been updated in Riak S2 and Stanchion as follows: cuttlefish 2.0.4, node_package 2.0.3, riak-erlang-client 2.1.1, lager 2.2.0, lager_syslog 2.1.1, eper 0.92 (Basho patched), cluster_info 2.0.3, riak_repl_pb_api 2.1.1, and riak_cs_multibag 2.1.0. [[PR 1190](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1190), [PR 1197 ](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1197), [PR 27](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs_multibag/pull/27), [PR 1245](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1245), and [PR 104](https://github.com/basho/stanchion/pull/104)].
* Riak CS has moved from Folsom to Exometer. [[PR 1165](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1165) and [PR 1180](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1180)]
* Improvements have been made to error tracing for retrieving blocks from client GET requests. There is a complex logic to resolve blocks when a GET is requested from the client. First, Riak CS tries to retrieve a block with `n_val=1`. If it fails, a retry will be done using `n_val=3`. If the block cannot be resolved locally, `proxy_get` is enabled, and the system is configured with datacenter replication, then Riak CS will try to perform a proxied GET to the remote site. The fallback and retry logic is complex and hard to trace, especially in a faulty or unstable situation. This improvement adds error tracing for the whole sequence described above, which will help diagnose issues. Specifically, for each block, the block server stacks all errors returned from the Riak client and reports the reason for every error as well as the type of call in which the error occurred. [[PR 1177](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1177)]
* Using the `GET Bucket` API with a specified prefix to list objects in a bucket needed optimization. It had been specifying end keys for folding objects in Riak too loosely. With this change, a tighter end key is specified for folding objects in Riak, which omits unnecessary fold in vnodes. [[PR 1233](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1233)]
* A limitation to the max length of keys has been introduced. This limitation can be specified as 1024 by default, meaning no keys longer than 1024 bytes can be PUT, GET or DELETED unless `max_key_length` is explicitly specified as more than '1024' in riak-cs.conf. If you want to preserve the old key length behaviour, you may specify the `max_key_length` as 'unlimited'. [[PR 1233](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1233)]
* If a faulty cluster had several nodes down, the block server misunderstood that a block was already deleted and issued a false-notfound. This could lead to block leak. The PR default has been set to 'quorum' in an attempt to avoid this problem. Updates have also been made to make sure at least a single replica of a block is written in one of the primary nodes by setting the PW default to '1'. Additionally, measures are in place to prevent the block server from crashing  when "not found" errors are returned due to a particular block of an object not being found in the cluster. Instead, unreachable blocks are skipped and the remaining blocks and manifests are collected. Since the PR and PW values are increased at blocks, the availability of PUTs and through-put of garbage collection may decrease. A few Riak nodes being unreachable may prevent PUT requests from returning successfully and may prevent garbage collection from collecting all blocks until the unreachable nodes come back. [[PR 1242](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1242)]
* The infinity timeout option has been set so that several functions make synchronous `gen_fsm` calls  indefinitely, which prevents unnecessary timeouts. [[PR 1249](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1249)]


##Bugs Fixed
* [[Issue 1097](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1097)/[PR 1212](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1212)] When `x-amz-metadata-directive=COPY` was specified, Riak CS did not actually COPY the metadata of original resource. Instead, it would treat it as a `REPLACE`.  When directed to `x-amz-metadata-directive=REPLACE` `Content-Type`, Riack CS would `REPLACE` it. Correct handling for the `x-amz-metadata-directive` has been added to PUT Object Copy API.
* [[Issue 1099](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1099)/[PR 1096](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1096)] There was an unnecessary NextMarker in Get Bucket's response if `CommonPrefixes` contained the last key. Fixed handling of uploaded parts that should be deleted after Multipart Complete Request.
* [[Issue 939](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/939)/[PR 1200](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1200)] Copy requests without Content-Length request headers failed with 5xx errors. Such requests are now allowed without Content-Length header in Copy API calls. Additionally, Copy API calls with Content-Lengths more than zero have been given explicit errors.
* [[Issue 1143](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1143)/[PR 1144](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1144)] Manual batch start caused the last batch time to appear to be in the future. All temporal shifts have been fixed.
* [[Issue PR 1162](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1162)/[PR 1163](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1163)] Fix a configuration system bug where Riak CS could not start if `log.syslog=on` was set.
* [[Issue 1169](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1169)/[PR 1200](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1200)] The error response of the PUT Copy API call showed the target resource path rather than the source path when the source was not found or not accessible by the request user. It now shows the source path appropriately.
* [[PR 1178](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1178)] Multiple IP address descriptions under a single condition statement of a bucket policy were not being properly parsed as lists.
* [[PR 1185](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1185)] If `proxy_get_active` was defined in riak-cs.conf as anything other than enabled or disabled, there would be excessive log output. Now, `proxy_get_active` also accepts non-boolean definitions.
* [[PR 1184](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1184)] `put_gckey_timeout` was used instead of `put_manifest_timeout` when a delete process tried to update the status of manifests.
* [[Issue 1201](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1201)/[PR 1230](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1230)] A single slow or silently failing node caused intermittent user fetch failure. A grace period has been added so `riakc_pb_socket` can attempt to reconnect.
* [[PR 1232](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1232)] Warning logs were being produced for unsatisfied primary reads. Since users are objects in Riak CS and CS tries to retrieve these objects for authentication for almost every request, the retrieval option (PR=all) would fail if even one primary vnode was stopped or unresponsive and a log would be created. Given that Riak is set up to be highly available, these logs were quite noisy. Now, the "No WM route" log from prior to Riak CS 2.1 has been revived. Also, the log severity has been downgraded to debug, since it indicates a client error in all but the development phase.
* [[PR 1237](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1237)]  The `riak-cs-admin` status command exit code was non-zero, even in successful execution. It will now return zero.
* [[Issue 1097](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1097)/[PR 1212](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1212) and [PR 4](https://github.com/basho/s3-tests/pull/4)] Riak S2 did not copy the metadata of an original resource when the `x-amz-metadata-directive=COPY` command was used, nor when `x-amz-metadata-directive` was specified. Handling of the `x-amz-metadata-directive` command in PUT Object Copy API has been added.
* [[Issue 1097](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1097)/[PR 1212](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1212) and [PR 4](https://github.com/basho/s3-tests/pull/4)] Riak CS did not store `Content-Type` in COPY requests when the `x-amz-metadata-directive=REPLACE` command was used. Handling of the `x-amz-metadata-directive` command in PUT Object Copy API has been added.
*  [[Issue 1097](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1097)/[PR 1212](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1212) and [PR 4](https://github.com/basho/s3-tests/pull/4)] Fixed the handling of uploaded parts that should be deleted after Multipart Complete Request.
* [[Issue 1214](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1244)/[PR 1246](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1246)] Prior to Riak S2 2.1.0, a PUT Copy API command with identical source and destination changed user metadata (`x-amz-meta-*` headers) but failed to update Content-Type. Content-Type is now correctly updated by the API call.
* [[Issue PR 1261](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1261), [[PR 1263](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1263)] Fix `riak-cs-debug` to include `app.config` when no generated files are found when `riak-cs.conf` is not used.



# Riak CS 2.0.1 Release Notes

## General Information
This is a bugfix release.

## Bug Fixes

* Fix config item `gc.interval` not working when `infinity` is set ([#1125](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1125)/[PR#1126](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1126)).
* Add `log.access` switch to disable access logging ([#1109](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1109)/[PR#1115](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1115)).
* Add missing riak-cs.conf items:` max_buckets_per_user` and `gc.batch_size` ([#1109](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1109)/[PR#1115](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1115)).
* Fix bugs around subsequent space characters for Delete Multiple Objects API and user administration API with XML content ([#1129](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/1129)/[PR#1135](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1135)).
* Fix URL path resource and query parameters to work in AWS v4 header authentication. Previously, `+` was being input instead of `%20` for blank spaces. ([PR#1141](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1141))

# Riak CS 2.0.0 Release Notes

## General Information

- This release updates Riak CS to work with Riak 2.0.5.
- We have simplified the configuration system.
- All official patches for older versions of Riak and Riak CS have been included
  in these releases. There is no need to apply any patches released for Riak CS
  1.4.x or 1.5.x to the Riak CS 2.0.x series. Patches released for Riak CS 1.4.x
  or 1.5.x cannot be directly applied to Riak CS 2.0.x because the version of
  Erlang/OTP shipped with Riak CS has been updated in version 2.0.0.
- Please review the complete Release Notes before upgrading.

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Access log can't be disabled.
- Advanced.config should be used to customize value of `max_buckets_per_user`
  and `gc_batch_size`.

## Changes and Additions

- Changed the name of `gc_max_workers` to `gc.max_workers`, and lowered the
  default value from 5 to 2 (#1110) to reduce the workload on the cs cluster.
- Partial support of GET Location API (#1057)
- Add very preliminary AWS v4 header authentication - without query
  string authentication, object chunking and payload checksum (#1064).
  There is still a lot of work to reliably use v4 authentication.
- Put Enterprise deps into dependency graph (#1065)
- Introduce Cuttlefish (#1020, #1068, #1076, #1086, #1090)
  (Stanchion #88, #90, #91)
- Yessir Riak client to measure performance (#1072, #1083)
- Inspector improvement with usage change (#1084)
- Check signed date in S3 authentication (#1067)
- Update `cluster_info` and various dependent libraries (#1087, #1088)
  (Stanchion #85, #87, #93)
- Storage calculation optimization (#1089) With Riak >= 2.1 this works
  with `use_2i_for_storage_calc` flag might relieve disk read of
  storage calculation.

## Bugfixes

- Fix wrong webmachine log handler name (#1075)
- Fix lager crash (#1038)
- Fix hardcoded crashdump path (#1052)
- Suppress unnecessary warnings (#1053)
- Multibag simpler state transition (Multibag #21)
- GC block deletion failure after transition to multibag environment
  (Multibag #19)
- Connection closing caused errors for objects stored before the
  transition, after transition from single bag to multibag
  configuration (Multibag #18).

## Deprecation Notices

- Multi-Datacenter Replication using v2 replication support has been deprecated.
- Old list objects which required `fold_objects_for_list_keys` as `false` have
  been deprecated and *will be removed* in the next major version.
- Non-paginated GC in cases where `gc_paginated_indexes` is `false` has been
  deprecated and *will be removed* in the next major version.


## General Notes on Upgrading to Riak CS 2.0.0

Upgrading a Riak CS system involves upgrading the underlying Riak, Riak CS and
Stanchion installations. The upgrade process can be non-trivial depending on
your existing system configurations and the combination of sub-system versions.
This document contains general instructions and notices on upgrading the whole
system to Riak CS 2.0.0.

#### New Configuration System

Riak 2.0.0 introduced a new configuration system (`riak.conf`), and as of Riak
CS 2.0.0, Riak CS now supports the new configuration style. Both Riak and Riak
CS still support the older style configurations through `app.config` and
`vm.args`.

**Basho recommends moving to the new unified configuration system**, using the
files `riak.conf`, `riak-cs.conf` and `stanchion.conf`.

##### Note on Legacy app.config Usage

**If you choose to use the legacy `app.config` files for Riak CS and/or
Stanchion, some parameters have changed names and must be updated**.

In particular, for the Riak CS `app.config`:
- `cs_ip` and `cs_port` have been combined into `listener`.
- `riak_ip` and `riak_pb_port` have been combined into `riak_host`.
- `stanchion_ip` and `stanchion_port` have been combined into `stanchion_host`.
- `admin_ip` and `admin_port` have been combined into `admin_listener`.
- `webmachine_log_handler` has become `webmachine_access_log_handler`.

For the Stanchion `app.config`:
- `stanchion_ip` and `stanchion_port` have been combined into `listener`.
- `riak_ip` and `riak_port` have been combined into `riak_host`.

Each of the above pairs follows a similar form. Where the old form used a
separate IP and Port parameter, the new form combines those as `{new_option, {
"IP", Port}}`. For example, if your legacy `app.config` configuration was
previously:

```
{riak_cs, [
    {cs_ip, "127.0.0.1"},
    {cs_port, 8080 },
    . . .
]},
```

It should now read:

```
{riak_cs, [
    {listener, {"127.0.0.1", 8080}},
    . . .
]},
```

and so on.

#### Note: Upgrading from Riak CS 1.5.3 or Older

[Some key objects changed names][riak_cs_1.5_release_notes_upgrading] after the
upgrade. Applications may need to change their behaviour due to this bugfix.

#### Note: Upgrading from Riak CS 1.5.0 or Older

[Bucket number limitation per user][riak_cs_1.5_release_notes_upgrading_1] have
been introduced in 1.5.1. Users who have more than 100 buckets cannot create any
bucket after the upgrade unless the limit is extended in the system
configuration.

#### Note: Upgrading From Riak CS 1.4.x

An operational procedure [to clean up incomplete multipart under deleted
buckets][riak_cs_1.5_release_notes_incomplete_mutipart] is needed. Otherwise new
buckets with names that used to exist can't be created. The operation will fail
with 409 Conflict.

Leeway seconds and disk space should also be carefully watched during the
upgrade, because timestamp management of garbage collection was changed in the
1.5.0 release. Consult the "[Leeway seconds and disk
space][riak_cs_1.5_release_notes_leeway_and_disk] section of 1.5 release notes
for a more detailed description.

#### Note: Upgrading From Riak CS 1.3.x or Older

Basho supports upgrading from the two previous major versions to the latest
release. Thus, this document will only cover upgrading from Riak CS versions
1.4.x and 1.5.x.

To upgrade to Riak CS 2.0.0 from versions prior to Riak CS 1.4.0, operators will
need to first upgrade their system to Riak CS version 1.4.5 or 1.5.4. Upgrading
to Riak CS 1.5.4 is recommended. The underlying Riak installation must also be
upgraded to the Riak 1.4.x series, preferably version 1.4.12.


## General Upgrade Instructions

#### All Scenarios

We recommend updating Stanchion before all other subsystems. Be careful not to
have multiple live Stanchion nodes accessible from Riak CS nodes at the same
time.

Repeat these steps on each node running Stanchion:

1. Stop Stanchion
2. Back up all Stanchion configuration files
3. Uninstall the current Stanchion package
4. Install the new Stanchion 2.0.0 package
5. Migrate the Stanchion configuration (See below)
6. Start Stanchion

#### Scenario: If Riak CS and Riak are both running on the same host.

Repeat these steps on every host:

1. Stop Riak CS
2. Stop Riak
3. Back up all Riak and Riak CS configuration files and remove all patches
4. Uninstall the current Riak CS package
5. Uninstall the current Riak Riak packages
6. Install the new Riak package
7. Install the new Riak CS 2.0.0 package
8. Migrate the Riak configuration (See below)
9. Migrate the Riak CS configuration (See below)
10. Start Riak
11. Start Riak CS

#### Scenario: If Riak CS and Riak are running on separate hosts.

When Riak CS is not installed on the same host as Riak, Riak CS can be upgraded
at any time while the corresponding remote Riak node is alive.

Repeat these steps on every host:

1. Stop Riak CS
2. Back up all configuration files and remove all patches
3. Uninstall the current Riak CS package
4. Install the new Riak CS 2.0.0 package
5. Migrate the Riak CS configuration (See below)
6. Start Riak CS


## Upgrade Stanchion to 2.0.0

When upgrading to Stanchion 2.0.0 the files `app.config` and `vm.args` are
migrated to the single file `stanchion.conf`. Configuration files are still
stored in the same location as before.

#### Migrate the Stanchion Configuration

Using the Configuration Mapping Tables below, edit your `stanchion.conf` to
preserve your configuration preferences between Riak CS 1.5.x and 2.0.0.

The tables show the old and new configuration format and default values.

##### `stanchion` section of the Stanchion app.config

|      1.5.4 (`app.config`)          |        2.0.0 (`stanchion.conf`)       |
|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
|`{stanchion_ip, "127.0.0.1"}`       |`listener = 127.0.0.1:8080`            |
|`{stanchion_port, 8085}`            |                                       |
|`{riak_ip, "127.0.0.1"}`            |`riak_host = 127.0.0.1:8087`           |
|`{riak_pb_port, 8087}`              |                                       |
|`{admin_key, "admin-key"}`          |`admin.key = admin-key`                |
|`{admin_secret, "admin-secret"}`    |`admin.secret = admin-secret`          |

##### `lager` section of the Stanchion app.config

Riak's Lager configuration can be copied directly to the `advanced.config` file.


##### Commented out by default and consequently `undefined` so as to disable SSL.

|      1.5.4 (`app.config`)          |        2.0.0 (`stanchion.conf`)       |

## Upgrade Riak to 2.0.5 and Configure for Riak CS 2.0.0

As Riak CS 2.0.0 only works on top of Riak 2.0.5 -- and does *not* work on top
of the Riak 1.x.x series -- the underlying Riak installation *must* be upgraded
to Riak 2.0.5. This document only covers upgrading from Riak 1.4.x. For more
general information on upgrading Riak, please see the Riak
[upgrading to 2.0 guide][upgrading_to_2.0].

Below are specific configuration changes required for a Riak 2.0.5 cluster
supporting Riak CS.

#### Upgrading Riak - Step 1: Set Default Bucket Properties

In older versions of Riak, default bucket properties has been configured in the
`app.config` as follows:

```erlang
{riak_core, [
   ...
   {default_bucket_props, [{allow_mult, true}]},
   ...
]}.
```

With Riak 2.0.5 in `riak.conf` this becomes:

```
buckets.default.allow_mult = true
```

#### Upgrading Riak - Step 2: `riak_kv` configuration

There are two ways to configure Riak 2.0.5 behind Riak CS 2.0.0:

**Option 1: Reuse the existing `app.config` file from Riak 1.4.x**

In this case, `add_paths` should be changed to target the new Riak CS binaries
installed by the Riak CS 2.0.0 package. These will be changed from
`"/usr/lib/riak-cs/lib/riak_cs-1.5.4/ebin"` to
`"/usr/lib/riak-cs/lib/riak_cs-2.0.0/ebin"`.

**Option 2: Use Riak 2.0.0's new `advanced.config`**

You will need to copy all riak_kv configuration items from `app.config` into
`advanced.config`, and update `add_paths` to target the new Riak CS binaries
installed by the Riak CS 2.0.0 package. In `advanced.config`, this will become:

```erlang
{riak_kv, [
  {add_paths, ["/usr/lib/riak-cs/lib/riak_cs-2.0.0/ebin"]}
]}.
```

The `app.config` file must be removed when `advanced.config` is used.

See [Setting up the Proper Riak Backend][proper_backend] for additional details.

#### Upgrading Riak - Step 3: Review Memory Size

Since the default configuration of the LevelDB memory size has changed, you will
need to review your memory size settings. The memory use of Riak CS is primarily
influenced by the Bitcask keydir and LevelDB block cache. Additionally, to
improve IO performance, some extra memory for the kernel disk cache should be
planned for. The equations below might help when specifying the memory size:

- Memory for backends = (Memory for Bitcask) + (Memory for LevelDB)
- Memory for storage = (Memory for backends) + (Memory for kernel cache)

##### LevelDB Block Cache Size

The configuration setting relating to the memory size of LevelDB has changed
from `max_open_files` to `total_leveldb_mem_percent` in 2.0. This specifies the
total amount of memory consumed by LevelDB. Note that the default memory limit
has changed from being proportional to the number of `max_open_files` to being a
percentage of the system's physical memory size.

Configuring `total_leveldb_mem_percent` is *strongly recommended* as its
[default value of 70%][configuring_elvevedb] might be too aggressive for a
multi-backend configuration that also uses Bitcask. Bitcask keeps its keydir in
memory, which could be fairly large depending on the use case.

##### Bitcask keydir Sizing

Bitcask stores all of its keys in memory as well as on disk. Correctly
estimating the total number of keys and their average size in Bitcask is very
important for estimating Bitcask memory usage. Total number of keys `N(b)` in
Bitcask across the whole cluster will be:

```
N(b) = N(o, size <= 1MB) + N(o, size > 1MB) * avg(o, size > 1MB) / 1MB
```

where `N(o, size <= 1MB)` is the number of objects with a size less than 1MB,
while `N(o, size > 1MB` is the number of objects with a size greater than 1MB.
`avg(o, size > 1MB)` is the average size of objects greater than 1MB in size.
The number of keys in Riak CS is related to the amount of data stored in MBs.
If the average lifetime of objects is significantly smaller than the leeway
period, treat objects waiting for garbage collections as live objects on disk.
Actual numbers of key count per vnode are included in the output of
`riak-admin vnode-status`. There is an item named `Status` in each vnode
section, which includes the `key_count` in the `be_blocks` section.

Once the numbers of keys is known, estimate the amount of memory used by Bitcask
keydir as per the [Bitcask Capacity Planning][bitcask_capactiy_planning]
documentation.

The bucket name size is always 19 bytes (see `riak_cs_utils:to_bucket_name/2`)
and the key size is always 20 bytes (see `riak_cs_lfs_utils:block_name/3`). The
average value size is close to 1MB if large objects are dominant, otherwise it
should be estimated according to the specific use case. The number of writes is
3.

#### Upgrading Riak - Step 4: Changes in `vm.args`

The upgrade of Riak from the 1.4.x series to the 2.0.x series is described in
[Upgrading Your Configuration System][upgrading_your_configuration]. The
following are several major configuration items which are essential for Riak CS.
`erlang.distribution_buffer_size` is commented out by default.

| Riak 1.4                        | Riak 2.0                              |
|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|
|`+zdbbl`                         |`erlang.distribution_buffer_size = 1MB`|
|`-name riak@127.0.0.1`           |`nodename = riak@127.0.0.1`            |
|`-setcookie riak`                |`distributed_cookie = riak`            |

#### Upgrading Riak - Step 5: Storage Calculation

If storage statistics are desired on your system, several more configuration
options are required. Please see the [storage statistics
documentation][storage_statistics] for additional details.

#### Upgrading Riak - Additional Notes

The underlying Bitcask storage format has been changed in Riak 2.0.x to [fix
several important issues][riak_2.0_release_notes_bitcask]. The first start of
Riak after an upgrade involves an implicit data format upgrade conversion, which
means that all data files are read, and written out to new files. This might
lead to higher than normal disk load. The duration of the upgrade will depend on
the amount of data stored in Bitcask and the IO performance of the underlying
disk.

The data conversion will start with logs like this:

```
2015-03-17 02:43:20.813 [info] <0.609.0>@riak_kv_bitcask_backend:maybe_start_upgrade_if_bitcask_files:720 Starting upgrade to version 1.7.0 in /mnt/data/bitcask/1096126227998177188652763624537212264741949407232
2015-03-17 02:43:21.344 [info] <0.610.0>@riak_kv_bitcask_backend:maybe_start_upgrade_if_bitcask_files:720 Starting upgrade to version 1.7.0 in /mnt/data/bitcask/1278813932664540053428224228626747642198940975104
```

The end of the data conversion can be observed as info log entries in Riak logs
like this:

```
2015-03-17 07:18:49.754 [info] <0.609.0>@riak_kv_bitcask_backend:callback:446 Finished upgrading to Bitcask 1.7.0 in /mnt/data/bitcask/1096126227998177188652763624537212264741949407232

```


## Upgrading Riak CS to 2.0.0

#### Upgrading Riak CS - Step 1: Multibag Configuration

Multibag configurations must be moved to `advanced.config` for both Riak CS and
Stanchion.

#### Upgrading Riak CS - Step 2: Default Configurations

When upgrading to Riak CS 2.0.0 the files `app.config` and `vm.args` are
migrated to the single file `riak-cs.conf`. Configuration files are still stored
in the same location as before.

Note: **`app.config` should be removed** once you’ve completed the upgrade and
`riak-cs.conf` is being used.

Some important configuration changes occurred between 1.5.x and 2.0.0, and not
all items were translated one-to-one.

Using the Configuration Mapping Tables below, edit your `riak-cs.conf` to
preserve your configuration preferences between Riak CS 1.5.x and 2.0.0.

The tables show the old and new configuration format and default values.

Note: `storage.stats.schedule.$time` does not have any default value but an
example is added.

##### `webmachine` section of the Riak CS app.config

|      1.5.4 (`app.config`)          |        2.0.0 (`riak-cs.conf`)         |   note     |
|:-----------------------------------|:--------------------------------------|:-----------|
|`{server_name, "Riak CS"}`          |`server_name = Riak CS`                |            |
|`{log_handlers, ....}`              |`log.access = true`                    | from 2.0.1 |
|                                    |`log.access.dir = /var/log/riak-cs`    |            |

Due to a WebMachine change, if `log_handlers` are defined in `app.config` or
`advanced.config`, the log handler's name should be changed as follows:

```erlang
    {log_handlers, [
        {webmachine_access_log_handler, ["/var/log/riak-cs"]},
        {riak_cs_access_log_handler, []}
        ]},
```

This does not have to be changed if `log_handlers` is not defined in
`app.config` or `advanced.config`.

##### `lager` section of the Riak CS app.config

Riak's Lager configuration can be copied directly to the `advanced.config` file.

#### Upgrading Riak CS - Step 3: Commented Out Configurations

All commented out items are undefined and disabled, except modules.

`rewrite_module` and `auth_module` are commented out, but the default value does
not change from Riak CS 1.5.4. This section is for showing operators how to
change these settings to the OOS API.

|      1.5.4 (`app.config`)             |      2.0.0 (`riak-cs.conf`)     |
|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
|`{rewrite_module, riak_cs_s3_rewrite }`|`rewrite_module`                 |
|`{auth_module, riak_cs_s3_auth },`     |`auth_module`                    |
|`{admin_ip, "127.0.0.1"}`              |`admin.listener = 127.0.0.1:8000`|
|`{admin_port, 8000 }`                  |                                 |
|`{ssl, [`                              |                                 |
|`  {certfile, "./etc/cert.pem"}`       |`ssl.certfile`                   |
|`  {keyfile, "./etc/key.pem"}`         |`ssl.keyfile`                    |

#### Upgrading Riak CS - Step 4: Other Configurations

The following configurations do not have corresponding items in `riak-cs.conf`:

* `fold_objects_for_list_keys`
* `n_val_1_get_requests`
* `gc_paginated_indexes`

If these values are still set as `false`, they should be omitted from your Riak
CS 2.0.0 configuration.

If the old behavior is preferred, they must be included in the `riak_cs` section
of `advanced.config`.


## Downgrading Riak CS

### To Riak CS 1.5.x

To downgrade from Riak CS 2.0.0 to Riak CS 1.5.x and Stanchion 2.0.0 to
Stanchion 1.5.0, repeat the following instructions for each node:

1. Stop Riak CS
1. Stop Riak
1. Uninstall the Riak CS 2.0.0 package
1. Uninstall the Riak 2.0.5 package
1. Run the Bitcask downgrade script for all Bitcask directories\*
1. Install the desired Riak package
1. Install the desired Riak CS package
1. Restore configuration files
1. Start Riak
1. Start Riak CS

Finally, on any nodes running Stanchion:

1. Stop Stanchion
2. Uninstall the Stanchion 2.0.0 package
3. Install the desired Stanchion package
4. Restore Stanchion configuration files
5. Start Stanchion

\*The Bitcask file format has changed between Riak 1.4.x and 2.0.0. While the
implicit upgrade of Bitcask data files is supported, automatic downgrades of
Bitcask data files is not. For this reason downgrading requires a script to
translate data files. See also the [2.0 downgrade notes][downgrade_notes].


# Riak CS 1.5.4 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- Disable previous Riak object after backpressure sleep is triggered
  [riak_cs/#1041](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1041). This
  change prevents unnecessary siblings growth in cases where (a)
  backpressure is triggered under high upload concurrency and (b)
  uploads are interleaved during backpressure sleep. This issue does not
  affect multipart uploads.
- Fix an incorrect path rewrite in the S3 API caused by unnecessary URL
  decoding
  [riak_cs/#1040](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1040). Due to
  the incorrect handling of URL encoding/decoding, object keys including
  `%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]` (as a regular expression) or `+` had been
  mistakenly decoded. As a consequence, the former case was decoded to
  some other binary and for the latter case (`+`) was replaced with ` `
  (space). In both cases, there was a possibility of an implicit data
  overwrite. For the latter case, an overwrite occurs for an object
  including `+` in its key (e.g. `foo+bar`) by a different object with a
  name that is largely similar but replaced with ` ` (space, e.g. `foo
  bar`), and vice versa.  This fix also addresses
  [riak_cs/#910](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/910) and
  [riak_cs/#977](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/977).

## Notes on upgrading

After upgrading to Riak CS 1.5.4, objects including
`%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]` or `+` in their key (e.g. `foo+bar`) become
invisible and can be seen as objects with a different name. For the
former case, objects will be referred as unnecessary decoded key. For
the latter case, those objects will be referred as keys `+` replaced
with ` ` (e.g. `foo bar`) by default.

The table below provides examples for URLs including
`%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]` and how they will work before and after the
upgrade.

            | before upgrade     | after upgrade |
:-----------|:-------------------|:--------------|
 written as | `a%2Fkey`          |      -        |
    read as | `a%2Fkey`or`a/key` | `a/key`       |
  listed as | `a/key`            | `a/key`       |

Examples on unique objects including `+` or ` ` through upgrade:

            | before upgrade   | after upgrade |
:-----------|------------------|---------------|
 written as | `a+key`          |      -        |
    read as | `a+key`or`a key` | `a key`       |
  listed as | `a key`          | `a key`       |

            | before upgrade   | after upgrade |
------------|------------------|---------------|
 written as | `a key`          |      -        |
    read as | `a+key`or`a key` | `a key`       |
  listed as | `a key`          | `a key`       |

This fix also changes the path format in access logs from the single
URL-encoded style to the doubly-encoded URL style. Below is an example
of the old style:

```
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Jan/2015:08:27:07 +0000] "PUT /buckets/test/objects/path1%2Fpath2%2Fte%2Bst.txt HTTP/1.1" 200 0 "" ""
```

Below is an example of the new style:

```
127.0.0.1 - - [07/Jan/2015:08:27:07 +0000] "PUT /buckets/test/objects/path1%2Fpath2%2Fte%252Bst.txt HTTP/1.1" 200 0 "" ""
```

Note that the object path has changed from
`path1%2Fpath2%2Fte%2Bst.txt` to `path1%2Fpath2%2Fte%252Bst.txt` between
the two examples shown.

If the old behavior is preferred, perhaps because
applications using Riak CS have been written to use it, you can retain
that behavior by modifying your Riak CS configuration upon upgrade.
Change the `rewrite_module` setting as follows:

```erlang
{riak_cs, [
    %% Other settings
    {rewrite_module, riak_cs_s3_rewrite_legacy},
    %% Other settings
]}
```

**Note**: The old behavior is technically incorrect and implicitly
overwrites data in the ways described above, so please retain the old
behavior with caution.

# Riak CS 1.5.3 Release Notes

## Additions

- Add read_before_last_manifest_write option to help avoid sibling
  explosion for use cases involving high churn and concurrency on a
  fixed set of keys. [riak_cs/#1011](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1011)
- Add configurable timeouts for all Riak CS interactions with Riak to
  provide more flexibility in operational
  situations. [riak_cs/#1021](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/1021)

## Bugs Fixed

- Fix storage usage calculation bug where data for deleted buckets
  would be included in the calculation
  results. [riak_cs/#996](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/996)

# Riak CS 1.5.2 Release Notes

## Additions

- Improved logging around connection failures with Riak
  [riak_cs/#987](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/987).
- Add amendment log output when storing access stats into Riak failed
  [riak_cs/#988](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/988). This
  prevents losing access stats logs in cases of temporary connection
  failure between Riak and Riak CS. Access logs are stored in
  `console.log` at the `warning` level.
- Add script to repair invalid garbage collection manifests
  [riak_cs/#983](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/983). There is
  a [known issue](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/827) where
  an active manifest would be stored in the GC bucket. This script
  changes invalid state to valid state.

## Bugs Fixed

- Fix Protocol Buffer connection pool (`pbc_pool_master`) leak
  [riak_cs/#986](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/986) . Requests
  for non-existent buckets without an authorization header and
  requests asking for listing users make connections leak from the
  pool, causing the pool to eventually go empty. This bug was introduced
  in release 1.5.0.

# Riak CS 1.5.1 Release Notes

- Use new UUID for seed of canonical ID instead of secret [riak_cs/#956](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/956)
- Add max part number limitation [riak_cs/#957](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/957)
- Set timeout as infinity to replace the default of 5000ms [riak_cs/#963](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/963)
- Skip invalid state manifests in GC bucket [riak_cs/#964](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/964)

## Notes on Upgrading

### Bucket number per user

Beginning with Riak CS 1.5.1, you can limit the number of buckets that
can be created per user. The default maximum number is 100. While this
limitation prohibits the creation of new buckets by users, users that
exceed the limit can still perform other operations, including bucket
deletion. To change the default limit, add the following line to the
`riak_cs` section of `app.config`:


```erlang
{riak_cs, [
    %% ...
    {max_buckets_per_user, 5000},
    %% ...
    ]}
```

To avoid having a limit, set `max_buckets_per_user` to `unlimited`.

## Notes on Upgrading

### Riak Version

This release of Riak CS was tested with Riak 1.4.10. Be sure to
consult the
[Compatibility Matrix](http://docs.basho.com/riakcs/latest/cookbooks/Version-Compatibility/)
to ensure that you are using the correct version.

### Incomplete multipart uploads

[riak_cs/#475](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/475) was a
security issue where a newly created bucket may include unaborted or
incomplete multipart uploads which was created in previous epoch of
the bucket with same name. This was fixed by:

- on creating buckets; checking if live multipart exists and if
  exists, return 500 failure to client.

- on deleting buckets; trying to clean up all live multipart remains,
  and checking if live multipart remains (in stanchion). if exists,
  return 409 failure to client.

Note that a few operations are needed after upgrading from 1.4.x (or
former) to 1.5.0.

- run `riak-cs-admin cleanup-orphan-multipart` to cleanup all
  buckets. To avoid some corner cases where multipart uploads can
  conflict with bucket deletion, this command can also be run with a
  timestamp with ISO 8601 format such as `2014-07-30T11:09:30.000Z` as
  an argument. When this argument is provided, the cleanup operation
  will not clean up multipart uploads that are newer than the provided
  timestamp. If used, this should be set to a time when you expect
  your upgrade to be completed.

- there might be a time period until above cleanup finished, where no
  client can create bucket if unfinished multipart upload remains
  under deleted bucket. You can find [critical] log (`"Multipart
  upload remains in deleted bucket <bucketname>"`) if such bucket
  creation is attempted.

### Leeway seconds and disk space

[riak_cs/#470](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/470) changed the
behaviour of object deletion and garbage collection. The timestamps in
garbage collection bucket were changed from the future time when the
object is to be deleted, to the current time when the object is
deleted, Garbage collector was also changed to collect objects until
'now - leeway seconds', from collecting objects until 'now'.

Before (-1.4.x):

```
           t1                         t2
-----------+--------------------------+------------------->
           DELETE object:             GC triggered:
           marked as                  collects objects
           "t1+leeway"                marked as "t2"
```

After (1.5.0-):

```
           t1                         t2
-----------+--------------------------+------------------->
           DELETE object:             GC triggered:
           marked as "t1"             collects objects
           in GC bucket               marked as "t2 - leeway"
```

This means that there will be a period where no objects are collected
immediately following an upgrade to 1.5.0. If your cluster is upgraded
at `t0`, no objects will be cleaned up until `t0 + leeway` . Objects
deleted just before `t0` won't be collected until `t0 + 2*leeway` .

Also, all CS nodes which run GC should be upgraded *first.* CS nodes
which do not run GC should be upgraded later, to ensure the leeway
setting is intiated properly. Alternatively, you may stop GC while
upgrading, by running `riak-cs-admin gc set-interval infinity` .

Multi data center cluster should be upgraded more carefully, as to
make sure GC is not running while upgrading.

## Known Issues and Limitations

* If a second client request is made using the same connection while a
  copy operation is in progress, the copy will be aborted. This is a
  side effect of the way Riak CS currently handles client disconnect
  detection. See [#932](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/932) for
  further information.

* Copying objects in OOS interface is not yet implemented.

* Multibag, the ability to store object manifests and blocks in
  separate clusters or groups of clusters, has been added as
  Enterprise feature, but it is in early preview status. `proxy_get`
  has not yet been implemented for this preview feature.  Multibag is
  intended for single DC only at this time.

# Riak CS 1.4.5 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

* Fix several 'data hiding' bugs with the v2 list objects FSM [riak_cs/788](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/788)
* Don't treat HEAD requests toward BytesOut in access statistics [riak_cs/791](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/791)
* Handle whitespace in POST/PUT XML documents [riak_cs/795](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/795)
* Fix bad bucketname in storage usage [riak_cs/800](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/800)
  Riak CS 1.4.4 introduced a bug where storage calculations made while running
  that version would have the bucket-name replaced by the string "struct". This
  version fixes the bug, but can't go back and retroactively fix the old
  storage calculations. Aggregations on an entire user-account should still
  be accurate, but you won't be able to break-down storage by bucket, as they
  will all share the name "struct".
* Handle unicode user-names and XML [riak_cs/807](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/807)
* Fix missing XML fields on storage usage [riak_cs/808](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/808)
* Adjust fold-objects timeout [riak_cs/811](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/811)
* Prune deleted buckets from user record [riak_cs/812](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/812)

## Additions

* Optimize the list objects v2 FSM for prefix requests [riak_cs/804](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/pull/804)

* `sum_bucket` timeout crashes all storage calculation is fixed by [riak_cs/759](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/759) .

* Failure to throttle access archiver is fixed by [riak_cs/758](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/758) .

* Access archiver crash is fixed by [riak_cs/747](https://github.com/basho/riak_cs/issues/747) .

  objects written with a version of Riak CS older than 1.3.0.

## Additions

- Add option to delay initial GC sweep on a node using the
  initial_gc_delay configuration option.
- Append random suffix to GC bucket keys to avoid hot keys and improve
  performance during periods of frequent deletion.
- Add default_proxy_cluster_id option to provide a way to specify a
  default cluster id to be used when the cluster id is undefined. This is
  to facilitate migration from the OSS version to the
  Enterprise version.

  overwrite or delete that could lead to old object versions being
  resurrected.
- Fix improper capitalization of user metadata header names.
- Fix issue where the S3 rewrite module omits any query parameters
  that are not S3 subresources. Also correct handling of query
  parameters so that parameter values are not URL decoded twice. This
  primarily affects pre-signed URLs because the access key and request
  signature are included as query parameters.
- Fix for issue with init script stop.

# Riak CS 1.3.0 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- Fix handling of cases where buckets have siblings. Previously this
  resulted in 500 errors returned to the client.
- Reduce likelihood of sibling creation when creating a bucket.
- Return a 404 instead of a 403 when accessing a deleted object.
- Unquote URLs to accommodate clients that URL encode `/` characters
  in URLs.

# Riak CS 1.2.2 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- Fix problem where objects with utf-8 unicode key cannot be listed
  nor fetched.
- Speed up bucket_empty check and fix process leak. This bug was
  originally found when a user was having trouble with `s3cmd
  rb s3://foo --recursive`. The operation first tries to delete the
  (potentially large) bucket, which triggers our bucket empty
  check. If the bucket has more than 32k items, we run out of
  processes unless +P is set higher (because of the leak).

## Additions

- Full support for MDC replication

# Riak CS 1.2.1 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- Return 403 instead of 404 when a user attempts to list contents of
  nonexistent bucket.

  the default mode, only the administrator is allowed to create
  accounts.
- Ping resource for health checks.
- Support for user-specified metadata headers.
- User accounts may be disabled by the administrator.
- A new key_secret can be issued for a user by the administrator.
- Administrator can now list all system users and optionally filter by
  enabled or disabled account status.

  request body
- Requests hang when a node in the Riak cluster is unavailable
- Correct inappropriate use of riak_moss_utils:get_user by
  riak_moss_acl_utils:get_owner_data

# Riak CS 1.0.0 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- Fix PUTs for zero-byte files

- Use a single Riak connection per request to avoid deadlock conditions
- Object ACLs
- Management for multiple versions of a file manifest
- Configurable block size and max content length
- Support specifying non-default ACL at bucket creation time

# Riak CS 0.1.2 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- Return 403 instead of 503 for invalid anonymous or signed requests.
- Properly clean up processes and connections on object requests.

# Riak CS 0.1.1 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- HEAD requests always result in a `403 Forbidden`.
- `s3cmd info` on a bucket object results in an error due to missing
  ACL document.
- Incorrect atom specified in `riak_moss_wm_utils:parse_auth_header`.
- Bad match condition used in `riak_moss_acl:has_permission/2`.

# Riak CS 0.1.0 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- `s3cmd info` fails due to missing `'last-modified` key in return document.
- `s3cmd get` of 0 byte file fails.
- Bucket creation fails with status code `415` using the AWS Java SDK.

## Other Additions

- Bucket-level access control lists
- User records have been modified so that an system-wide unique email
  address is required to create a user.
- User creation requests are serialized through `stanchion` to be
  certain the email address is unique.
- Bucket creation and deletion requests are serialized through
  `stanchion` to ensure bucket names are unique in the system.
- The `stanchion` serialization service is now required to be installed
  and running for the system to be fully operational.
- The concept of an administrative user has been added to the system. The credentials of the
  administrative user must be added to the app.config files for `moss` and `stanchion`.
- User credentials are now created using a url-safe base64 encoding module.

## Known Issues

- Object-level access control lists have not yet been implemented.

# Riak CS 0.0.3 Release Notes

## Bugs Fixed

- URL decode keys on put so they are represented correctly. This
  eliminates confusion when objects with spaces in their names are
  listed and when attempting to access them.
- Properly handle zero-byte files
- Reap all processes during file puts

## Other Additions

- Support for the s3cmd subcommands sync, du, and rb

 - Return valid size and checksum for each object when listing bucket objects.
 - Changes so that a bucket may be deleted if it is empty.

- Changes so a subdirectory path can be specified when storing or retrieving files.
- Make buckets private by default
- Support the prefix query parameter

- Enhance process dependencies for improved failure handling

## Known Issues

- Buckets are marked as /private/ by default, but globally-unique
  bucket names are not enforced. This means that two users may
  create the same bucket and this could result in unauthorized
  access and unintentional overwriting of files. This will be
  addressed in a future release by ensuring that bucket names are
  unique across the system.
