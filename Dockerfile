# When running in a docker container, ideally we would want our app to
# be configurable via environment variables (option --env-file to
# docker run).  For that reason, We use a pared-down, cuttlefish-less
# rebar.config.  Configuration from environment now becomes possible,
# via rebar's own method of generating sys.config from
# /sys.config.src.
